# Installation

- git clone this in your player directory
- copy the ``modtools.vspec`` file into the ``vspec`` directory in player
	- mostly because i have not figured out how to generate/automatically do this yet

---

open up a terminal in player:
```
call env.bat
cta toontown
python -m modtools.tests.TestStart
```
